## Problem Statement

> "I just moved to a new city — where do I stay, and how do I survive the first month?"

Students and professionals face:

- Scattered, unverified hostel/PG listings  
- Fake reviews and outdated photos  
- No way to find nearby grocery, mess, laundry, or shops  
- Wasted time, uncertainty, and poor living experiences  

There is no centralized platform that solves both accommodation and local survival.
